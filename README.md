# Machine-Learning-Journey
A repository to track my progress in the field of Machine Learning

# Completed Projects:

* Binary Classification task:

> Build Machine Learning classification model to Predict the machine state of the Machine,
i.e machine will fail or machine remains normal
functional based on machine attributes


* Predictive regression task:

> Build a predictive regression model to predict the PC prices based on the PC attribute given like CPU, Weight,ScreenSize Etc
